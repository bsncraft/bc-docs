### Contracts Portal
The Contracts Portal is a web based version of specific BusinessCraft functions currently providing the ability to create and maintain Customers, Customer Contacts, Leads and Contracts including Events, Estimates, Documents, Job Information, Display Centre Statistics and Variation functionality.

Where BusinessCraft is used for functions beyond Contract Management, it is good practice that the Contracts Portal uses a separate BusinessCraft dataset (often referred to as the Contracts Database) for the records created so that the data is segregated from the primary BusinessCraft dataset.

The Lead Conversion Process in the target BusinessCraft Live dataset can be used to access the Customer, Customer Contact and Contract from the Contracts Database (the source) and create those records in the BusinessCraft Live dataset cross referencing the Contract records in both datasets.

The Contracts Portal currently provides the following functions:
- Customer, Customer Contact and Lead (Contract) details can be created and edited.
- Sales Estimates can be created, edited and printed for Leads and Contracts.
- Job information can be recorded for Leads and Contracts.
- Document records comprising file notes with or without attachments can be linked to Leads and Contracts.
- Events can be defined and registered for Leads and Contracts with required dependencies.
- User defined Display Centre statistics such as weather, traffic etc. can be recorded and reviewed.
